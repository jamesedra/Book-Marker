# Book Marker

## Mark the books that interest you.

*What is Book Marker?*
- Book Marker is an application for tracking the books the user has read, wants to read, or is currently reading.<br> 
Possible features include the details of the books such as: the title, the author/s, the date it was published,
the cover page, and if it belongs to a set of books (such as being included on a 7-book series). User features 
will involve the current status if it's being read or not, the chapter or page of the book they are currently on, 
the number of books in their log, and the user's rating and reviews when possible. <br>

*Who is this for?*
- Book Marker is for people who would like to keep track of the things they have been reading without using an
online database in order to create a small viewpoint of their own library.

*Why does this interest you?*
- I would like to keep track of the books I have read, currently reading, or I am interested in. There are also
some books that I have read before that were not published, so it was hard to keep track of them, even locally.
